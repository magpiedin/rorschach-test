### From 13th Age:

#### Why do we have an anti-harassment policy?

Nobody shows up for a game with the goal of feeling uncomfortable or unsafe, and sorry that they came. But organized play brings together many different types of people with different expectations and approaches to play. An anti-harassment policy sets ground rules that everyone can recognize and follow, resulting in better games and more fun.

#### The 5 principles of 13th Age organized play

At a 13th Age organized play event:

- Everyone has the right to be listened to.
- Everyone has the right not to have their feelings belittled.
- Everyone has the right to set boundaries on themselves and their property.
- Everyone has the right to a space that is safe from any type of harassment: physical, verbal, emotional, or sexual.
- Everyone has the right to a space that is free from language, actions, or behavior that are racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, or which denigrate participants’ religious beliefs and affiliations (including the lack thereof), or ethnic or national origin.

These rights are shared by players and GMs. Infringing on these rights is harassment, and can lead to being removed from the game.

!!What if I’m being harassed at a 13th Age organized play event?

- Find a 13th Age organized play GM immediately and report it. They’ll take swift action to investigate and address the problem. (See “What happens to the harasser?”)
- If you ARE the GM, report itto the store owner, convention organizer, or whoever’s in charge of the space where you’re running the event.
- If you feel as though you need other avenues to resolve the problem the GM will be happy to help you contact convention security, the store owner and/or local police if  you request them. 
- If you disagree with how a GM orevent organizer implemented or enforced this policy at an event, please email ourdirector of organized play, ASH LAW, at ash.law@fireopalmedia.com. Please be specific about who, what, where, and when. We’ll investigate and take appropriate actions, up to and including removing the infringing party from the 13th Age organized play program.

#### What happens to the harasser?

You don’t have to keep playing with somebody who’s determined to make things unfun for others. If someone at a 13th Age organized play event is violating this policy, the GM can take any action that he or she decides is necessary to stop the harassment--ranging from a simple warning to removal from the game. If it’s necessary to resolve the situation, the GM can escalate it to the store owner, event organizers, or onsite security

#### GMs: How to Use this Policy
We understand that it can be hard to run a game event with a group of strangers (or even friends). Everyone brings different experiences to the table, and what some players will find difficult, uncomfortable, or painful will pose no problems to others. Here’s some time-tested guidance for applying the policy.

#### Talk with your hosts before the event
If you’re at a store or convention, they probably have their own anti-harassment policies and procedures for enforcing them. Find out what those policies and procedures are, so that you’re familiar with all of the guidelines that apply to this event.Let your hosts know in advance that you might come to them during the game if there’s a problem that you can’t resolve by yourself, and make sure they’re willing and able to support you if you need it.

#### Familiarize your players with the policy

Make sure your players read and understand the above policy and the store/convention policy (if there is one). Feel free to hand out a copy, give them time to read it, and ask them if they have questions.

#### Set expectations before the game

Consider having a brief conversation before the game about topics and stories that people would rather avoid during play. 

- Take the initiative by going first and naming something you don’t like to see in games:“I don’t want to see bad things happen to children,”or “I don’t want to see violence against pregnant women”. Then ask if there’s anything anyone else would prefer not be part of the game. One of your players might name something that you included as part of your prep. That’s cool—13th Age makes improvising easy. Just change your story to remove or change the element that causes discomfort.
- If a more formal approach appeals to you, consider using an X-Card: http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg
- If an informal approach suits you better, watch the reactions of your players and adjust accordingly.

#### Pause the action

If a player says that something that’s been narrated makes them uncomfortable, pause the action and come up with an alternative that the player can be happy with. Don’t pressure them to go along for the sake of the story.

#### Check your players’ comfort level

If you see signs that players are feeling uncomfortable, check in to make sure they are okay. You don’t need to make a big deal of it. “You look uncomfortable -is this okay? Or should we rewind a bit?”is enough. Often, simply knowing that their feelings are being respected is enough to make players feel okay.

#### Speak up when you see harassment

If you see something going on at the event that you’re uncomfortable with, chances are others are uncomfortable with it too. Harassment needs silence to thrive.Speak up. Please! Ask those involved if they are okay with what is happening or being said. Be courteous yet firm.</pre>

### Appropriate Games
As stated above, when you agree to run any event at Gamehole Con for our attendees you are doing so with the express understanding that you are running said event in a way to provide a fun and entertaining experience for our attendees. This does not include providing "shocking" or "horrifying" experiences in a game. 
When submitting a game, please make sure to engage the appropriate age range selection for your expected players. Adult themed games are appropriate for adults. If you do plan on running a game that contains adult themes, it is incumbent upon each and every GM to provide a full explanation of the adult situations contained in your game in the body of the game's event description. There simply cannot be any room for surprises when it comes to subjects that might be offensive or objectionable to our attendees.
To be absolutely clear on this subject, themes, scenarios, or encounters based on graphic violence and/or sexual content is never appropriate for a gaming event at Gamehole Con. This includes descriptions of rape, extreme violence, or extreme cruelty. Please let common sense be your guide in this. Some matters that might be acceptable in a home game involving consenting adults are not acceptable at a gaming convention. Violations of these edicts are violations of our Attendee and Code of Conduct polices and can result in immediate expulsion without refund as well as a permanent ban from any and all future Gamehole Con events, shows, or activities.
